# Quality Control {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Statistical Methods for Quality

- Statistical Design of Experiments (DOEs): For process and product design.
    - One-factor ANOVA (Chapter 13).
    - Factorial design, etc.
- Statistical Process Control (SPC): Monitoring and controlling process for stability over time.
- Acceptance Sampling: Sorting products into conforming or nonconforming products, and lot sentencing.



## Quality

- The American Society for Quality (ASQ) defines quality as:

> “the characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.”

- U.S. Organizations recognize that they must strive for high levels of quality (Car industry in 1980's).

- In addition to managerial philosophy, they have increased the emphasis on statistical methods for monitoring and maintaining quality.


## Total Quality

- **Total Quality (TQ)** is a people-focused management system that aims at continual increase in customer satisfaction at continually lower real cost.
    - TQ is a total system approach (not a separate work program) and an integral part of high-level strategy. TQ works horizontally across functions (Concurrent engineering).
    - TQ involves all employees, top to bottom, and extends backward and forward to include both the supply and customer chains.
    - TQ stresses learning and continuous improvement as keys to organizational success.
        - Learning -> Improve quality -> Increased productivity -> Lower cost -> Gain in market share -> Stay in business -> Responsibility to society.



## Quality Gurus and Philosophies (1 of 3)

### Dr. Walter A. Shewhart
- Developed a set of principles that are the basis for what is known today as process control.
- Constructed a diagram that would now be recognized as a statistical control chart.
- Brought together the disciplines of statistics, engineering, and economics and changed the course of industrial history.
- Recognized as the father of statistical quality control.



## Quality Gurus and Philosophies (2 of 3)

### Dr. W. Edwards Deming
- Helped educate the Japanese on quality management shortly after World War II.
- Father of modern Total Quality Management: Stressed that the focus on quality must be led by managers.
- Developed a list of 14 points he believed represent the key responsibilities of managers.
- Japan named its national quality award the Deming Prize in his honor.



## Quality Gurus and Philosophies (3 of 3)

### Joseph Juran
- Helped educate the Japanese on quality management shortly after World War II.
- Proposed a simple definition of quality: **fitness for use**
- His approach to quality focused on three quality processes: quality **planning**, quality **control**, and quality **improvement**.



## Quality Frameworks (1 of 7)

### Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award
- Established in 1987 and given by the U.S. president to organizations that judged to be outstanding in:
    1. Leadership
    2. Strategy
    3. Customer measurement, analysis, and knowledge management
    4. Workforce
    5. Operations
    6. Results



## Quality Frameworks (2 of 7)

### Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (continued)
- The first awards were presented in 1988.
- The Award is named for Malcolm Baldrige, who was U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 1981 to 1987.
- The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) manages the Award.



## Quality Frameworks (3 of 7)

### ISO 9000 series
- A series of five standards published in 1987 by the International Organization for Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland.
- The standards describe the need for:
    - an effective quality system,
    - ensuring that measuring and testing equipment is calibrated regularly,
    - maintaining an adequate record-keeping system.
- ISO 9000 registration determines whether a company complies with its own quality system.



## Quality Frameworks (4 of 7)

### Six Sigma

- Emphasizes the importance of taking measurements on critical quality characteristics.
- Focuses more on the process **variation** than the process mean.
- **A process is a Six Sigma process if its mean is centered, and the distances between the mean and Upper and Lower Specifications are six times the process's standard deviation (σ).**
- Six sigma level of quality means that for every million opportunities, no more than **3.4** defects will occur if the process mean drifts or shifts slightly.
- The methodology created to reach this quality goal is referred to as [Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma).



## Quality Frameworks (5 of 7)

- Six Sigma aims for defects to be so minimal that only **3.4 per million** occur.
- The target is represented as a bell curve centered at the mean ($\mu$) with six standard deviations (σ) between the mean and the specification limits.

    ![Defective Rate = Total tail areas](https://example.com/six-sigma-bell-curve)  
    (Note: Replace with actual path or include the figure directly if possible)

    - Defective Rate = NORM.S.DIST(-6, TRUE) + {1 - NORM.S.DIST(6, TRUE)} ≈ 0



## Quality Frameworks (6 of 7)

- With Six Sigma, shifts in the process mean are accommodated.
    - A shift of 1.5σ still maintains low defect rates.
    - This shift leads to a defect rate of approximately 3.4 per million produced.

    ![Defective Rate for Shifted Mean](https://example.com/six-sigma-shifted-mean)  
    - Defective Rate = NORM.S.DIST(-7.5, TRUE) + {1 - NORM.S.DIST(4.5, TRUE)} ≈ 0.0000034 = 3.4 per million produced



## Quality Frameworks (7 of 7)

### Quality in the Service Sector

- Quality control is critical in service businesses (e.g., law firms, hotels, airlines, restaurants, and banks).
- Focus on customer satisfaction and improving the customer experience.
- Services are often intangible, making customer satisfaction subjective and quality measurement challenging.




title: "Quality Terminology and Statistical Process Control"
format: revealjs


# Quality Terminology

- **Quality assurance** refers to the entire system of policies, procedures, and guidelines established by an organization to achieve and maintain quality.
- Quality assurance consists of two functions:
  - **Quality engineering** - its objective is to include quality in the design of products and processes and to identify potential quality problems prior to production.
  - **Quality control** consists of making a series of inspections and measurements to determine whether quality standards are being met.



# Statistical Process Control (SPC) (1 of 3)

- Critical process quality characteristic is inspected and measured.
  - There will always be variation in the unit-to-unit measurements.
  - Two types of causes of variation: Common Causes and Assignable Causes.
  - Common causes are allowed for the time being, but assignable causes need to be removed immediately.
  - Adjusting a process with only common cause variations will increase process variation. (The well-known Deming’s funnel experiment.)

- The **goal** of SPC is to detect and eliminate the assignable causes as soon as possible, based on samples from the process **over time**.



# Common Causes (2 of 3)

- Randomly occurring variations in materials, humidity, temperature, etc.
- Variation is natural and unexplained.
- Affecting **all** units/outputs.
- Variations the producer cannot control (in the short-term).
- Process is in **statistical control** and hence, does not need adjustment.



# Assignable Causes (3 of 3)

- Non-random and identifiable (significant) variations in output due to tools wearing out, operator error, incorrect machine settings of a few machines, poor quality raw material from certain vendors, etc.
- Affecting certain or **individual** outputs.
- Process is **out of control**, and the producer can and must control (immediately).
- **Corrective action** should be taken.



# Applications

- Temperature of a die
- Weights of bags of potato chips of a filling process
- Weekly sales figures
- Customer complaints
- Product responses
- Inventory level
- Absenteeism
- Accidents
- Account receivables
- Process defective rate



# SPC vs. Hypothesis Testing (1 of 2)

SPC: To monitor and control the parameters (mean, variability, or proportion) of a process at each time and over time.

- Based on hypothesis-testing methodology.
  
$$ 
H_0: \text{Process is in control } (\mu = \mu_0, \text{ or } R = R_0) 
$$
$$
H_a: \text{Process is out of control} 
$$

- The (non-standardized) test statistic is the monitoring statistic in SPC: $\overline{X}$ for process mean, $\overline{p}$ for process proportion, etc.



# Decisions and Errors (2 of 2)

| State of Production Process      | $H_0$ True (Process in Control) | $H_0$ False (Process Out of Control) |
|-|-||
| **Accept $H_0$** (Continue Process) | Correct decision                     | Type II error (allowing an out-of-control process to continue) |
| **Reject $H_0$** (Adjust Process) | Type I error (False alarm) (adjusting an in-control process) | Correct decision                       |

- Control the **Probability of a False Alarm** at $\alpha$ (the significance level).



# Control Charts (1 of 2)

- SPC uses graphical displays known as **control charts** to monitor a production process (mean, variability, or percent defectives).
- Chart design parameters: the center line (CL), upper control limit (UCL), and lower control limit (LCL).



# Control Charts (2 of 2)

- The CL represents what the process parameter value should be when the process is in control (denoted by $\mu_0$ or $R_0$).
- The UCL and LCL are the two-sided **critical values** for the monitoring statistic.
  - They are chosen so that when the process is in control, there will be a high probability that the monitoring statistic value will be between the two lines.
  - They are chosen to allow common causes variation in the process and hence in the monitoring statistic.
  - Values outside of the control limits provide strong evidence that the process is out of control.



# Variables Control Charts

A variable control chart is used to monitor and control a process parameter over time if the process’ quality characteristic, $X$, is continuous or numeric; for example, the completion time of a task, weight of a bag, temperature of a die, etc.

- $\overline{X}$ Chart is used to monitor the process mean ($\mu$) of $X$. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is the sample mean, $\overline{X}_j$.
- $R$ Chart is used to monitor the process range ($R$), a measure of variability. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is the sample range, $R_j$.


title: "X-bar Chart for Process Mean"
format: revealjs


## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (1 of 3)

- **Assume the in-control process mean and standard deviation are known.**

**Example: KJW Packaging**

When KJW’s cereal carton filling process is in control, the weight of cartons of cereal filled by the process is normally distributed with a mean of 16.05 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.10 ounces.

**Question:** What should be the control limits for $\bar{X}$ based on a sample of n = 10 observations?



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (2 of 3)

- Assume in-control process mean is $\mu_0$ and standard deviation is $\sigma$:

  $$
  \text{UCL} = \mu_0 + 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
  
  $$
  \text{CL} = \mu_0
  $$
  
  $$
  \text{LCL} = \mu_0 - 3 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

  where $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard deviation of $\bar{X}_j$ with a sample size of n.

- 3 is the z-multiplier with 99.97% confidence level, or a false alarm rate of $\alpha = 0.27\%$.



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (3 of 3)

**Example: KJW Packaging**

$$
\mu_0 = 16.05, \quad \sigma = 0.10, \quad n = 10
$$
$$
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.10}{\sqrt{10}} = 0.032
$$
$$
\text{UCL} = 16.05 + 3(0.032) = 16.146
$$
$$
\text{CL} = 16.05
$$
$$
\text{LCL} = 16.05 - 3(0.032) = 15.954
$$

A sample mean based on n observations outside the limits indicates the process mean is out of control.



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean: In-control Process Mean and Standard Deviation Unknown (1 of 7)

- **Assume the in-control process mean and standard deviation are unknown.**
  They need to be estimated from an in-control process.

**Example: Jensen Computer Supplies Problem**

JCS manufactures 3.5-inch-diameter solid state drives. It wants to develop an X-bar (for process mean) and Range charts (for process variability) based on twenty samples of 5 drives each.



# Data and Sample Summary Statistics (2 of 7)

- Table of sample observations with 5 observations per sample and calculated means and ranges.



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (3 of 7)

  $$
  \text{UCL} = \bar{X} + A_2 \bar{R}
  $$
  $$
  \text{CL} = \bar{X}
  $$
  $$
  \text{LCL} = \bar{X} - A_2 \bar{R}
  $$

  where:
  - $\bar{X}$ = overall sample mean (e.g., 3.4995)
  - $\bar{R}$ = average range (e.g., 0.0253)
  - $A_2$ = constant depending on n (from "Factors for Control Charts" table)



# Factors for $\bar{X}$ Control Chart (4 of 7)

- Table of factors for control charts showing values for different sample sizes (n), including $A_2$.



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (5 of 7)

Given:
- $\bar{X} = 3.4995$, $\bar{R} = 0.0253$, $n = 5$

Calculations:
$$
\text{UCL} = \bar{X} + A_2 \bar{R} = 3.4995 + 0.577(0.0253) = 3.514
$$
$$
\text{CL} = \bar{X} = 3.4995
$$
$$
\text{LCL} = \bar{X} - A_2 \bar{R} = 3.4995 - 0.577(0.0253) = 3.485
$$



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (6 of 7)

- Graph showing the $\bar{X}$ chart with control limits at 3.485 and 3.514.
- Conclusion: Process mean was in control in each time period.



## $\bar{X}$ Chart for Process Mean (7 of 7)

- **In case the process is out-of-control for some samples, exclude these samples and re-calculate the CL, UCL, and LCL to re-check the process.**
- This approach applies to other types of control charts as well.


title: "R Chart for Process Variability"
format: revealjs


# $R$ Chart for Process Variability (1 of 5)

- **Assume the in-control process mean and standard deviation are unknown.**

- Because the control limits for the $\bar{X}$ chart depend on the value of the average range ($\bar{R}$), these limits will not have much meaning unless the process range is in control.

- In practice, the $R$ chart is usually constructed before the $\bar{X}$ chart.
  - If the $R$ chart indicates that the process variability is in control, then the $\bar{R}$ is used when constructing the $\bar{X}$ chart.

- The plotting statistic is the Sample Range, $R_j$ (the last column on slide 29).



# $R$ Chart for Process Variability (2 of 5)

$$
\text{UCL} = D_4 \bar{R}
$$
$$
\text{CL} = \bar{R}
$$
$$
\text{LCL} = D_3 \bar{R}
$$

where:
- $\bar{R}$ = average range
- $D_3, D_4$ = constants that depend on $n$; refer to the "Factors for Control Charts" table.

**Example: Jensen Computer Supplies Problem**

Given:
- $\bar{X} = 3.4995$, $\bar{R} = 0.0253$, $n = 5$

Calculations:
$$
\text{UCL} = D_4 \bar{R} = 2.114(0.0253) = 0.053
$$
$$
\text{CL} = \bar{R} = 0.0253
$$
$$

- **Graph of $R$ Chart** showing control limits at UCL = 0.053 and LCL = 0.

- Conclusion: The process variability was in control in each sample.

title: "Attributes Control Charts and Sampling"
format: revealjs


## Attributes Control Charts

An attributes control chart is used if the quality of the output is measured in terms of discrete/counting data such as the number of defective units ($X$) in a sample, etc.

- $X$ is assumed to follow a Binomial distribution with a defective rate (proportion of “success”), $p$. The expected value of $X$ is $np$.
- **p Chart**: Used to monitor $p$. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is the sample proportion $\overline{p_j}$.
- **np Chart**: Used to monitor the expected number of defectives in a sample of size $n$, $np$. The monitoring statistic at time $j$ is $X_j$.



## p Chart for Process Proportion (1 of 4)

Assume the in-control process proportion is known as $p_0$.

- **UCL** = $p_0 + 3\sigma_{\overline{p}}$
- **CL** = $p_0$
- **LCL** = $p_0 - 3\sigma_{\overline{p}}$

where 

$$
\sigma_{\overline{p_j}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}
$$

assuming $np_0 \geq 5$ and $n(1 - p_0) \geq 5$.

**Note**: If computed LCL is negative, set LCL = 0.



## p Chart for Process Proportion (2 of 4)

Assume the in-control process proportion is **unknown**.

**Example**: Automated mail-sorting process.

The automated mail sorting process in a post office scans the zip codes on the letters and diverts them to the proper carrier route. Suppose a sample of 200 letters is selected each hour for 24 hours to establish control limits for a **p chart**, where $p$ is the proportion of incorrectly sorted letters.



## Sample Data

| Sample | Sample Size | Number of Incorrects | Sample Proportion |
|--|-|-|-|
| 1      | 200         | 6                    | 0.03             |
| 2      | 200         | 2                    | 0.01             |
| ...    | ...         | ...                  | ...              |
| 24     | 200         | 2                    | 0.01             |

$\overline{p} =$ Estimated overall defective rate  
$$
\overline{p} = \frac{\text{Total number of incorrects}}{\text{Total sample size}} = \frac{104}{4800} = 0.0217
$$



## p Chart for Process Proportion (3 of 4)

**Example**: Automated mail-sorting process

$\overline{p} = 0.0217$

$$
\sigma_{\overline{p_j}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\overline{p}(1 - \overline{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.0217(1 - 0.0217)}{200}} = 0.0103
$$

- **UCL** = $\overline{p} + 3\sigma_{\overline{p}} = 0.0217 + 3(0.0103) = 0.0526$
- **CL** = $\overline{p} = 0.0217$
- **LCL** = $\overline{p} - 3\sigma_{\overline{p}} = 0.0217 - 3(0.0103) = -0.0092 \rightarrow 0$



## p Chart for Process Proportion (4 of 4)

![P Chart of Number of Incorrects](path/to/image)

The process is out-of-control in Hour 8.



## np Chart for Expected Number of Defectives

- **UCL** = $np + 3\sqrt{np(1 - \overline{p})}$
- **CL** = $np$
- **LCL** = $np - 3\sqrt{np(1 - \overline{p})}$

assuming $np \geq 5$ and $n(1 - \overline{p}) \geq 5$.

**Note**: If computed LCL is negative, set LCL = 0.



## Interpretation of Control Charts

- The location and pattern of points in a control chart enable us to determine, with a small probability of error, whether a process is in statistical control.
- A primary indication that a process may be out of control is a **data point outside the control limits**.
- Certain patterns of points within the control limits can be warning signals of quality problems (**Nelson’s 8 rules**):
  - A large number of points on one side of the center line (9 points).
  - Six or seven points in a row that indicate either an increasing or decreasing trend.



## Lot Acceptance Sampling

- **Acceptance sampling** is a statistical method that enables us to base the accept-reject decision on the results of inspection of a sample of items from the lot.
- The items of interest can be incoming shipments of raw materials or purchased parts as well as finished goods from final assembly (End-of-line inspection).
- Acceptance sampling has advantages over 100% inspection including:
  - Usually less expensive.
  - Less product damage due to less handling.
  - Fewer inspectors required.
  - Provides the only approach possible if destructive testing must be used.



## Lot Acceptance Simple Sampling Procedure

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Lot received] --> B[Sample selected];
    B --> C[Sample inspected for quality];
    C --> D[Results compared with specified quality characteristics];
    D --> E[Quality is satisfactory] --> F[Accept the lot] --> G[Send to production or customer];
    D --> H[Quality is not satisfactory] --> I[Reject the lot] --> J[Decide on disposition of the lot];
```


## Lot Acceptance Sampling vs HT

- **Acceptance sampling** is based on hypothesis-testing methodology.
- **H₀**: Good-quality lot vs. **Hₐ**: Poor-quality lot



## Hypothesis Testing in Acceptance Sampling

| **State of the Lot**       | **H₀ True** <br> (Good-Quality Lot)         | **H₀ False** <br> (Poor-Quality Lot)           |
|-||--|
| **Accept the Lot**         | Correct decision                            | Type II error <br> (accepting a poor-quality lot) <br> *Consumer Risk* |
| **Reject the Lot**         | Type I error <br> (rejecting a good-quality lot) <br> *Producer Risk* | Correct decision                              |



## Recall: Binomial Distribution

- **X**: Number of defectives in a sample of size **n**
- **p**: Incoming lot proportion of defectives

$$
P(X = x) = f(x) = \frac{n!}{x!(n - x)!} p^x (1 - p)^{(n - x)} = \text{Binom.dist}(x, n, p, 0)
$$

$$
P(X \leq x) = f(0) + \dots + f(x) = \text{Binom.dist}(x, n, p, 1)
$$



## Example (1 of 7): KALI, Inc.

KALI, Inc. manufactures home appliances and uses acceptance sampling to monitor quality. Suppose a sample of 15 items is selected from each incoming shipment. The policy is to accept a lot if at most one defective item is found.

Find the probability of accepting the lot when the defective rate of the incoming lot is 5%.



## Example (2 of 7): Calculation

- **n = 15**, **c = 1**
- **p = 0.05**

$$
P(\text{Accept Lot}) = P(X \leq 1) = f(0) + f(1) = 0.8290 \quad \text{(using Binom.dist(1, 15, 0.05, 1))}
$$

$$
P(\text{Reject Lot}) = 1 - 0.8290 = 0.1710
$$



## Selecting an Acceptance Sampling Plan (3 of 7)

Managers must consider the following:

- **Producer's risk**: Probability of rejecting a lot with an acceptable defective rate.
- **Consumer's risk**: Probability of accepting a lot with an unacceptable defective rate.



## Example (4 of 7): Acceptance Probability Table

| **p**  | **Acceptance Probability** |
|--|--|
| 0.0    | 1.0000                     |
| 0.05   | 0.8290                     |
| 0.1    | 0.5490                     |
| 0.15   | 0.3186                     |
| ...    | ...                        |
| 1.0    | 0.0000                     |

- Use **Binom.dist** function in Excel to calculate probabilities.



## Selecting an Acceptance Sampling Plan (5 of 7)

Define parameters for the plan:

- **p₀**: Maximum acceptable defective rate (under **H₀**)
  - **α**: Probability that a lot with defective rate **p₀** will be rejected (*Producer’s risk*)
- **p₁**: Minimum unacceptable defective rate (under **Hₐ**)
  - **β**: Probability that a lot with defective rate **p₁** will be accepted (*Consumer’s risk*)



## Example (6 of 7): Sample Plan Requirements

Suppose we require:
- **p₀ = 0.03**, **α = 8%** (Producer's Risk)
- **p₁ = 0.15**, **β = 4%** (Consumer's Risk)

Is (n, c) = (15, 0) an acceptable plan?



## Is (n, c) = (15, 0) Acceptable? (7 of 7)

- **Producer’s risk**:
  $$
  P(\text{Reject the lot} \mid p = 0.03) = 1 - \text{Binom.dist}(0, 15, 0.03, 1) = 0.367 \quad \text{(Too high)}
  $$

- **Consumer’s risk**:
  $$
  P(\text{Accept the lot} \mid p = 0.15) = \text{Binom.dist}(0, 15, 0.15, 1) = 0.087 \quad \text{(Close)}
  $$



## Multiple Sampling Plans

- A **multiple sampling plan** uses two or more stages of sampling.
- At each stage, decisions include:
  - Stopping and accepting the lot,
  - Stopping and rejecting the lot,
  - Continuing sampling.
- **Multiple sampling plans** can reduce total sample size while maintaining Type I and Type II error levels.
