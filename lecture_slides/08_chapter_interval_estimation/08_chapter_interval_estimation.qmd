# Continuous Probability Distributions<br><br>Chapter #6 {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Continuous Probability Distributions

<br>

- A continuous random variable can assume any value in an interval on the real line or in a collection of intervals.

- We donâ€™t normally talk about the probability of a continuous random variable assuming a particular value, because it is always 0 $P(X=x)=0$.

- Instead, we talk about the probability of the random variable assuming a value within a given interval $P(X \in (a,b))$.

<br>

- The probability of the random variable assuming a value within some given interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is defined to be the area under the graph of the probability density function between $x_1$ and $x_2$.

## Area as a Measure of Probability

<br>

- The area under the graph of $f(x)$ and probability are identical.
- This is valid for all continuous random variables.
- The probability that $x$ takes on a value between some lower value $x_1$ and some higher value $x_2$ can be found by computing the area under the graph of $f(x)$ over the interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$.


# Normal Probability Distribution {background-color="#cfb991"}


## Normal Probability Distribution

<br>

- The normal probability distribution is the most common distribution for describing a continuous random variable.

- It is widely used in statistical inference, especially because of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

- It has been used in a wide variety of applications including:

    - Heights of people
    - Test scores
    - Rainfall amounts
    - Scientific measurements

- Abraham de Moivre, a French mathematician, published *The Doctrine of Chances* in 1733. He derived the normal distribution.

<br>

## Normal Probability Distribution

<br>

- **Normal Probability Density Function**

  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
  $$

  where:
  - $\mu$= population mean
  - $\sigma$= population standard deviation
  - $\pi = 3.14159$
  - $e = 2.71828$

- The distribution is symmetric with respect to mean; its skewness measure is zero.
- The graph of the distribution is a bell-shaped curve.

## Normal Probability Distribution

<br>

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/normal_dist.png") 
```

**Characteristics**

- The entire family of normal probability distributions is defined by its mean $\mu $and its standard deviation $\sigma$. Denoted by $N(\mu, \sigma)$.
- The highest point on the normal curve is at the mean, which is also the median and mode.
- The mean can be any numerical value: negative, zero, or positive. The mean determines the location of the distribution.

<br>

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/normal_sd.png") 
```

**Characteristics**

- The standard deviation determines the width of the curve: larger values result in wider, flatter curves.
- Probabilities for the normal random variable are given by areas under the curve. The total area under the curve is 1 (.5 to the left of the mean and .5 to the right).

```

**Characteristics**

- A random variable having a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is said to have a standard normal probability distribution.

- Also called a z-distribution; Denoted by $Z$ or $N(0,1)$.

**Standardization: Standardize $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ to standard Normal Distribution, $Z$**

  $$
  Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
  $$

- We can think of $Z$ as a measure of the number of standard deviations $X$ is from $\mu$. (Cf. Standardization in Chapter 1.)
  
    - Conversely, $X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma$. If $X$ can be written as $X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma$ where $Z$ is standard normal, then $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

- The letter z is used to designate the standard normal random variable.

## Excel to Compute Standard Normal Probabilities

<br>

- Excel functions for standard normal probability distributions.

  - `=NORM.S.DIST(z, TRUE)` function computes the cumulative probability for a given $z$ value of the standard normal distribution.

  - `=NORM.S.INV(cumulative probability)` function computes the $z$ value for a given cumulative probability of the standard normal distribution.

  - "S" in the function names reminds us that these functions relate to the standard normal probability distribution.

  - "TRUE" or "1" indicates a cumulative probability is requested.

# Summary  {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Summary

Some key takeaways from this session:

-   **Descriptive Statistics**: help us to understand the data we have.

-   **Measures of Central Location and Variability**: Central location and variability metrics help us to summarize the data.

-   **Distribution Shape**: skewness can be used to understand the shape of a distribution.

-   **Relative Location and z-Scores**: z-scores to determine the relative position of data points within a distribution.

-   **Empirical Rule**: The 68-95-99.7 Rule for understanding data distribution in relation to the mean and standard deviation. Good for symetric distrubutions!

- **Covariance and Correlation**: to understand the relationship between two numerical variables.
