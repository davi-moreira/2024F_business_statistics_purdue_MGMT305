Groups will be required to submit the complete source code of their assignments (.ipynb, .qmd, or .html). Each problem set will be meticulously evaluated, with grading based on both the accuracy and the overall quality of the work submitted. For instance, you must guarantee:\n\nAll code must run;\nEach problem set material will have its own GitHub repository;\nReadable Solutions: To facilitate effective evaluation and comprehension of the coding assignments, students must adhere to the following standards for code readability:\n\nComprehensive Commenting: All code must include thorough comments. These comments are essential as they allow the Professor and Teaching Assistants to understand the purpose and functionality of the code solely through these annotations. It is crucial that the comments are clear and concise, providing insight into the logic and purpose behind each segment of code.\n\n\nStructured Code Segmentation: Solutions should be methodically organized into distinct code chunks within Jupyter or R Markdown notebooks. For clarity on this format, refer to examples provided in class or consult with the Professor or Teaching Assistants.\n\n\nDetailed Documentation of Functions: Every function defined by a student must be accompanied by a docstring. This documentation should clearly explain the function’s purpose, describe each input argument, and outline what the function returns.",

    "text": "Assessments\n\nGrading\nFollowing a university-wide initiative, the School has adopted an Official Grading Policy for core courses such as MGMT 30500. Under this policy, the overall GPA for this class can be no higher than 3.0. To comply with this course policy, final course letter grades will be based on the curved class final course percentages. The final course percentage is based on a weighted percentage computed using the weights shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nHomework*\n40%\n\n\nQuizzes**\n15%\n\n\nMidterms***\n15%\n\n\nAttendance/Participation\n7%\n\n\nFinal****\n13%\n\n\n\n*There are eight homework assignments. No homework assignment is dropped. The final homework score is calculated using aggregated points.\n** There are three quizzes worth 5% each. Quizzes 2 and 3 are not cumulative.\n***There are two midterms: each is worth 7.5%. Midterms are not cumulative.\n**** Final is cumulative.\n\n\nHomework\nThere are eight Homework Assignments – check the due dates in the schedule. Each Homework Assignment contains\n\nexercise problems from the text, and\nsupplementary problems.\nPlease note: Homework is accepted only by being properly and timely uploaded to Brightspace. Homework is not accepted late or in any other way, including by email, for any reason. Also, all students must be assessed on the same work so ad-hoc extra-credit or makeup assignments will not be given.\n\nHomework assignments must be submitted online through Brightspace. Brightspace will be set to allow you 2 chances to submit the assignment. If you submit twice, only your second submission will be graded. The first will not be looked at.\nMake sure to upload only one file (pdf) for each homework assignment. No supplements, attachments, or appendices can be used. Do not upload Word or page documents.\nImportant: You must include all relevant software output that addresses the homework questions and reference it clearly where appropriate. Copy and paste all software output that addresses the homework questions into your homework papers, and reference it clearly where appropriate, but do not copy and paste any datasets into your homework papers.\nIf an exercise instructs you to do a computation by hand, you do not have to include the by-hand work in your homework paper. This makes it easier to turn your work in online to Brightspace. However, you should make sure that you can do the by-hand computation by checking your answer against Excel’s result. You will need to do the by-hand computations on exams so, again, make sure you know how to do them.\nIn your submissions, homework problems must be clearly identified by their respective chapter and problem numbers.\nYour proficiency in this course will improve if these problems are done faithfully and in a timely fashion. Try not to wait until the last minute to do your homework.\nYou may discuss the homework problems with classmates, but DO NOT COPY. You are expected to write your homework individually. Duplicate papers are considered cheating.\nYour homework submissions are graded by the course graders. If you have any issues about the grading, please refer to the paragraph, Grade Challenges, below.\n\n\nQuizzes\nTo encourage students to work steadily through the materials, three quizzes are given. Quizzes 2 and 3 are not cumulative. The quizzes will each count for 5% of the final course percentage and none are dropped. Only under exceptional circumstances, when legitimate and verifiable reasons are provided, will make-ups be given. “Exceptional circumstances” means a death in the family, a serious personal medical emergency, participation in a conflicting NCAA athletic event, or as otherwise required by University policies. Except for emergencies, requests for a makeup must be made by email with supporting documentation no later than 7 days before the scheduled quiz.\n\n\nExams\nExams will test both technical ability to carry out standard calculations and your understanding of important concepts. Exams are closely based on homework exercises but do not expect the exams to be identical to homework assignments. Exams and homework are designed to assess different types and levels of understanding. There will be two Midterms and a Final, all given in-person. The second Midterm is not cumulative. The Final is cumulative. You will need a calculator for taking exams. Calculators that have USB ports or can access the internet are not permitted nor are you allowed to use a smart phone or watch as a calculator. You are required to take all exams. (None are dropped.) Only under exceptional circumstances, when legitimate and verifiable reasons are provided, will make-ups be given. “Exceptional circumstances” means a death in the family, a serious personal medical emergency, participation in a conflicting NCAA athletic event, or as otherwise required by University policies. Except for emergencies, requests for a makeup must be made by email with supporting documentation no later than 7 days before the scheduled exam.\nAttendance and Participation: Attend your classes, pay attention and participate. If you do not attend class, you will likely not succeed. According to the University regulations (https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=15&navoid=18634#classes), “Scheduled courses allow students to avoid conflicts and reflect the University’s expectation that students should be present for every meeting of a class/laboratory for which they are registered.” The instructor will take random attendance and keep the attendance record. Your attendance/participation grade will be based on this record.\n\n\nGrade Challenges\nWhen grades are posted in the Brightspace Grade Center, an announcement will be posted on Brightspace. Any challenge to any grade must be made within 7 calendar days of the posting of the announcement. There is one exception: to facilitate the computation of final course grades, the last homework assignment must be challenged within three days of the posting of grades. Grade challenges must be based on good faith disputes about mathematical or statistical principles. They cannot be based on post-hoc legalistic arguments.\nTo challenge a homework score, quiz score or exam score, you must send the instructor an email describing your challenge. Include your name, ID, and Assignment Number. Please note: General grade reviews for homework are not done. For homework, the challenge must cite the instructor to a specific deduction and provide a reason it is believed to be incorrect. Please check the Homework Solutions before submitting a homework grade challenge. Most often, the Homework Solutions will provide the basis for the deduction(s). Grades will not be discussed in the classroom during, between, or after classes.\nAfter the 7 day challenge period, all grades are final for purposes of calculating the final course grade.",

    "text": "KEYS TO SUCCESS\nYou will succeed in this course if you adhere to the following:\n\nConsistent Effort: Follow the schedule outlined in the Course Outline diligently.\nPre-Class Preparation:\n\nRead the lecture material and annotations before your scheduled class. Refer to the Course Schedule to determine the appropriate chapter to read. The readings are typically brief, especially considering the included tables and figures.\nReview the homework exercises for the relevant chapter before class. These exercises will be the primary focus during class sessions.\n\nClass Materials:\n\nEither print the readings, annotations, and homework exercises, or ensure you have them accessible on your laptop or tablet. This will allow you to take notes directly on the materials during class.\n\nEngagement with Problems:\n\nUnderstanding statistics and data analysis requires exposure to numerous examples and practice with many problems. It is crucial to recognize that this course may differ from others: even if you comprehend the lectures and readings, you may initially struggle with the problems.\nMake an effort to solve the assigned homework problems independently. Continuously work on the chapter problems as the course progresses. Regular practice, particularly after each chapter lecture, will help you master the problems.\n\nActive Learning:\n\nAdhering to these procedures is essential for success in this class. Relying solely on in-class presentations without engaging with the course materials will likely result in difficulties.",

Examples include gender, type of car, and nationality.\nOrdinal: Categories that have a specific order or ranking. Examples include satisfaction levels (e.g., satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied) and education levels (e.g., high school, bachelor’s, master’s).\n\nNon-numeric: Categorical data not represented by numbers.\n\nNominal: Similar to numeric nominal data but represented with non-numeric labels. Examples include types of cuisine (e.g., Italian, Chinese, Indian).\nOrdinal: Similar to numeric ordinal data but represented with non-numeric labels. Examples include rankings such as job positions (e.g., intern, junior, senior).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Data\n\nDefinition: Data that can be measured and expressed numerically.\nSubcategories:\n\nNumeric: Quantitative data always represented by numbers.\n\nInterval: Numerical data with meaningful differences between values but no true zero point. Examples include temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.\nRatio: Numerical data with meaningful differences between values and a true zero point. Examples include height, weight, and sales figures."
